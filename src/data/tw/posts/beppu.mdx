Unlike other locations where cats make their living in the countryside or on isolated islands, I found the cats in Beppu living around the old hot spring streets and residential areas near the train station.

## En Route to the Back Alleys in Beppu

### [train] Beppu 別府

Beppu is a famous hot spring city. It is easy for backpackers to find their way by train, especially when I had a JR Pass.

Opposite to the excited tourists in the train station waiting for their hot spring holidays, olny local residents went through the shopping streets and the stores looked old.

At the time I visited, I saw many local residents greet the cats like neighbors. However, I was wondering if there were some gathering spots but didn't find any. Judging by the cats resting in front of houses or store doors, it seemed that many residents might provide food for them.
