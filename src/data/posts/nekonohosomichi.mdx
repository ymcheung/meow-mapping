When we wandered around the streets near Onomichi Station, we found that cats were featured in all kinds of foods and gifts. The local stores are friendly to the cats and welcome them to rest there.

## Neko no Hosomichi 猫の細道

To visit Neko no Hosomichi, we set Senkoji (千光寺) as our destination. Since Senkoji is a popular tourism spot, we decided to meet the cats early in the morning and had to hike up the mountain, which took around 30 minutes.

With temples, century-old houses, bamboo, and trees along the way, we were surprised to find ourselves already in Neko no Hosomichi. As we were greeted by the area's owners (the cats we were expecting), Senkoji is about a 10-minute climb ahead.

## Bonus: Onomichi City Museum of Art 尾道市立美術館

Onomichi City Museum of Art is the bonus cat spot next to Senkoji. A black cat named “Ken-chan” has been trying to infiltrate the museum since 2017. People celebrated his first victory in 2024.
