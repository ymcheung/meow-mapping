When we wandered around the streets near Onomichi Station, we found that cats were featured in all kinds of foods and gifts. The local stores were friendly to the cats and welcomed them to rest there.

## Neko no Hosomichi 猫の細道

To visit Neko no Hosomichi, we made Senkoji Temple (千光寺) our destination from the train station. Since it’s a popular tourist spot, we aimed to meet the cats early in the morning. That meant hiking up the mountain, which took about 30 minutes.

With temples, century-old houses, bamboo, and trees along the way, we were surprised to find ourselves already in Neko no Hosomichi. As we were greeted by the area’s owners (the cats we were expecting), Senkoji was about a 10-minute climb ahead.

The quality of our trip was greatly enhanced by our encounters with two or three groups of tourists and local residents along the way. We highly recommend starting the hike before 8:00 am for the best experience.

## Bonus: Onomichi City Museum of Art 尾道市立美術館

Onomichi City Museum of Art is the bonus cat spot next to Senkoji. A black cat named “Ken-chan” has been trying to infiltrate the museum since 2017. People celebrated his first victory in 2024.
