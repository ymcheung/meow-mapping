<Abstract transportation={frontmatter.transportation} />

As the symbol of a tourist destination in Kyoto, almost everyone visiting Kyoto for the first time will go to Fushimi Inari Taisha to take pictures with the long-anticipated Senbon Torii.

## Senbon Torii 千本鳥居

Most people stopped at Senbon Torii, but I planned to hike deep into the back mountain before sunset. After passing through the area, scattered bungalows and temples hinted at encountering cats in this world-famous spot.

## Mt. Inari 稻荷山

For safety, I could only hike the lower route since it would get dark quickly after 17:00. Cats didn’t appear until I made my way back along the path.

Most of the cats were staying in the gardens or cemeteries of the temples. This made them look mysterious, as if some of them were gods in disguise.

Did you hike up to the higher route and find a hidden gem of the spot? Please share the experience with us.
