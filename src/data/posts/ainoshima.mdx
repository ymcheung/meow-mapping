Ainoshima is an island at the north end of Kyushu. You will spot more than 100 cats by simply wandering around the port of the island. Although a local organization by the residents takes care of the cats, some of them look ill and weak.

## Access

### From Hakata 博多

When you visited Kyushu in Japan, you would probably stay in Fukuoka, which is the largest city in Kyushu. On the way to Shingu Town, where the only ferry to Ainoshima is located, it is necessary to transfer to the private railway, Nishitetsu (西鉄).

### Shingu Town 新宮町

The local bus from Nishitetsu-Shingu Station (西鉄新宮駅) to Shingu Town runs five times a day before 17:00. Therefore, I choose to have a 25-minute-walk. Some people ride taxis instead. Eventually, you may discover that a bunch of cat lovers gather in the waiting room at the port.

Your cat island trip starts when approaching the port because some cats stay between Shingu Port and Ainoshima. They greet you when you are waiting for one of the four ferries of the day.

### Commute Ferry to Ainoshima 相島

In short, the waves are strong, so it’s wise to prepare any necessary medication before setting out. To prevent making others uncomfortable, you might consider staying on the second-floor deck. Additionally, standing on the deck rather than sitting can be beneficial.

Once you reach Ainoshima, it is important to jot down the time back to Shingu Port because there are only 5 ferries a day.

## Ainoshima 相島

The cats wander around the port and the nearby residence area. During your time on the island, every moment offers an excellent opportunity to take photos of their tiny interactions.

Before you leave Ainoshima, please spend some time in the waiting room where you can witness cats trespassing and ignoring the notices posted on the door for them.
