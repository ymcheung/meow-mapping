Ainoshima is an island at the north end of Kyushu. I met more than 100 cats by simply wandering around the port of the island. Although a local organization by the residents took care of the cats, some of them looked ill and weak.

## En Route to Ainoshima

### [train] Starting from Hakata 博多

When you visit Kyushu in Japan, you will probably stay in Fukuoka, which is the largest city in Kyushu. On the way to Shingu Town, where the only ferry to Ainoshima is located, it is necessary to transfer to the private railway, Nishitetsu (西鉄).

### [walk] Shingu Town 新宮町

The local bus from Nishitetsu-Shingu Station (西鉄新宮駅) to Shingu Town ran five times a day before 17:00. Therefore, I chose to have a 25-minute-walk. Some people rode taxis instead. Eventually, you might discover that a bunch of cat lovers gathered in the waiting room at the port.

Your cat island trip started when approaching the port because some cats stayed between Shingu Port and Ainoshima. Maybe some of them have taken the ferries many times. They greeted us when I was waiting for one of the five ferries of the day.

### [ferry] Ferry to Ainoshima 相島

In short, the waves were strong, so it was wise to prepare any necessary medication before setting out. To prevent making others uncomfortable, I stayed on the second-floor deck. Additionally, standing on the deck rather than sitting could be beneficial.

Once you reached Ainoshima, it was important to jot down the time back to Shingu Port because there were only 5 ferries a day.

## Ainoshima 相島

The cats wandered around the port and the nearby residence area. During your time on the island, every moment offerred an excellent opportunity to take photos of their tiny interactions.

Before you left Ainoshima, please spend some time in the waiting room where you could witness cats trespassing and ignoring the notice posted on the door for them.
