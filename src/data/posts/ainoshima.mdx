## Access

### From Hakata 博多

When you visited Kyushu in Japan, you would probably stay in Fukuoka, which is the largest city in Kyushu. On the way to Shingu Town, where the only ferry to Ainoshima is located, it is necessary to transfer to the private railway, Nishitetsu (西鉄).

### Shingu Town 新宮町

If you are fortunate enough, upon arriving at Nishitetsu-Shingu Station (西鉄新宮駅), you can catch the transit bus to Shingu port. While most people opt to walk the 25-minute journey, there are a few tourists like yourself who may find it challenging to simply follow the crowd. Eventually, you may discover that fellow cat lovers gather in the waiting room at the port.

Your cat island trip starts here because some cats stay between Shingu Port and Ainoshima.

### Commute Ferry to Ainoshima 相島

In short, the waves are strong, so it's wise to prepare any necessary medication before setting out. To prevent making others uncomfortable, you might consider staying on the second-floor deck. Additionally, standing on the deck rather than sitting can be beneficial.

Once you reach Ainoshima, it is important to jot down the time back to Shingu Port because there are only 5 ferries a day.

The cats wander around the port and the nearby residence area. It is polite not to trespass their properties.
