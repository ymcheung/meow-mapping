Gotanjouji is located in the peaceful countryside of Fukui 福井県, making it a destination that requires a full day’s journey from nearby larger cities.

## Access

### Takefu Station 武生駅

For foreign visitors, the best way to reach Takefu was to take Shinkansen to Fukui Station 福井駅 and then transferred to Takefu. At the time we visited in 2023, express trains were more convenient and there was no need to transfer.

### Bicycle Ride

Gotanjouji was not winthin our eye sights upon arrival at Takefu Station. Instead of taking a taxi for approximately 20 minutes, we enjoyed a leisurely bicycle ride that took about 1.5 hours.

Takefu was primarily a residential town, and we were the only two tourists at the train station. Even though there were only two rental bicycles available at the tourism information center, we still rented them without a reservation around noon.

We only rented the bicycles for 4 hours, thinking that would be enough for this rural trip. However, it took us almost 1.5 hours to find our way. If we had the chance to go there again, we would choose to rent them for 8 hours.

## Gotanjouji 御誕生寺

Gotanjouji has adopted up to 20 cats for years. They were healthy and clean overall.

We asked the Reverend where we should park our bicycles, and he guided us to park them next to the restroom.

The feeding time should be in early morining or late evening. Unfortunately, during our visit, which was between 11:00 and 14:00, we were not lucky enough to watch the cats enjoying the meal.
