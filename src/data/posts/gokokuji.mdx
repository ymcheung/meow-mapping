Gokokuji 護國寺 is easy to reach as it’s near a train station in Tokyo. On weekends, there are flea markets in the mornings and the temple is busy with people. Cats can be seen hiding from the crowds in the plaza or parking lots.

## Access

### Ikebukuro 池袋

Ikebukuro is at the center of Tokyo. All you need to notice is to differentiate among JR lines, Tokyo Metro, and private railways.

## Gokokuji 護國寺

Gokokuji is not known for taking care of cats. So you won’t find omamori or goshuin stamps here.
