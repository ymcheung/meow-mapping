The train from Tokyo to Enoshima is straightforward. As there are many visitors, it is impossible to get lost by following the crowd.

## Access

### Kamakura 鎌倉

It takes around 1.5 hours from Tokyo to Kamakura Station 鎌倉駅. Once you’re in Kamakura, the stores that specialize in cat-themed items for everyday life are definitely worth a visit!

### Enoshima Electric Railway 江ノ島電鉄

Besides taking the Enoshima Electric Railway, many people choose walking along the railway and the coast line to enjoy as much of the scene.

## Enoshima 江ノ島

The island tends to be overcrowded during holidays, making it an undesirable destination at that time. Few cats would show up.
