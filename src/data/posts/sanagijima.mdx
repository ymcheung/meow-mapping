Sanagijima is an island located in the Seto Inland Sea. While this region hosts the Setouchi International Art Triennale every three years, it does not feature any exhibitions on the island itself.

## Access

### Tadoutsu 多度津

The ferry to Sanagijima is located at Tadotsu. It takes around 20 minutes from the train station by walking, or 5 minutes by taking a taxi.

### Commute Ferry to Sanagijima 佐柳島

There are three ferry departures daily between Tadotsu and Sanagijima, so be prepared for a possible wait at the port. Got a Japanese motorcycle license? You can bring your motorcycle or rent one for the ferry ride.

The ferry is comfortable and clean. There’s no need to take pills before being aboard. The trip is ~1 hour with a brief stop at Takamishima.

It is recommended that you spend one or two nights on the island to experience the day and night views of Seto Naikai. The only hostel on Sanagijima, Nekonojima, requires a reservation. The walk from the port to Nekonojima takes ~15 minutes. In my experience, I decided to stay for a night because the hotel is refurbished from an abandoned elementary school.

The health condition of the cats in Sanagijima is generally average; however, some are sick and underweight. The hotel appears to be the only reliable facility caring for them, while other locations for food and water are somewhat neglected.

The hotel is located a bit away from the residential area. Most of the time, cat lovers like yourself meet each other instead of the local residents there. When the sun is about to set, the cat lovers from the other three “classes” gather at the entrance of the school. They pet the cats with the gentle sound of waves from beyond the breakwater as background music, and they get to know each other as true cat lovers.

For an isolated island in Seto Naikai, you might think the meals would be as simple as curry rice. In fact, what you are going to have could be some of the best seafood with local vegetables you have ever tasted.

The night view is truly spectacular, but for your safety, it's best to stay close to the hotel.
