import Abstract from '@pages/[category]/[...blogPost]/_Abstract.astro';

Sanagijima is an island located in the Seto Inland Sea. While this region hosts the Setouchi International Art Triennale every three years, it does not feature any exhibitions on the island itself.

## Access

### Tadoutsu 多度津

The ferry to Sanagijima is located at Tadotsu. It takes around 20 minutes from the train station by walking, or 5 minutes by taking a taxi.

### Commute Ferry to Sanagijima 佐柳島

There are three ferry departures daily between Tadotsu and Sanagijima, so be prepared for a possible wait at the port. At the time of our visit, we saw some local residents ride motorcycles onto the ferry.

The ferry is comfortable and clean. There’s no need to take pills before being aboard. The trip is ~1 hour with a brief stop at Takamishima.

It is recommended that you spend one or two nights on the island to experience both the daytime and nighttime views of Seto Naikai. The only hostel on Sanagijima, Neconoshima (ネコノシマホステル), requires a reservation. The walk from the port to Neconoshima takes ~15 minutes. We decided to stay for a night because the hostel is refurbished from an abandoned elementary school.

Along the way to the hostel, we observed that the health condition of the cats in Sanagijima was generally average; however, some were sick and underweight. The hostel appeared to be the only reliable facility caring for them, while other locations for food and water were somewhat neglected.

The hostel was a bit away from the residential area. Most of the time, we met with the host and other cat lovers instead of the local residents there. When the sun began to set, we gathered at the entrance of the school and petted the cats with the gentle sound of waves from beyond the breakwater providing a soothing background. Some of the guests began to share why they are cat lovers.

For an isolated island in Seto Naikai, we expected the meals to be as simple as curry rice. In fact, what we had could be some of the best seafood with local vegetables we have tasted.

The night view was truly spectacular. However, it is best to stay close to the hostel for safety. Don’t worry—cats also gathered around the classrooms for their dinner.

We owned the view of dawn exclusively and interacted with cats by getting up very early in the morning and were anticipating breakfast already when talking about the meal last night.
