## Access

### Tadoutsu 多度津

The ferry to Sanagijima is located at Tadotsu. It takes around 20 minutes from the train station by walking, or 5 minutes by taking a taxi.

### Commute Ferry to Sanagijima 佐柳島

There are three ferry departures daily between Tadotsu and Sanagijima, so be prepared for a possible wait at the port. Got a Japanese motorcycle license? You can bring your motorcycle or rent one for the ferry ride.

The ferry is comfortable and clean. There’s no need to take pills before being aboard. The trip is ~1 hour with a brief stop at Takamishima.

It is recommended that you spend one or two nights at the island and feel the day and night views with Seto Naikai. The only hostel in Sanagijima, Nekonojima, is reservation only. The walk from the port to Nekonoshima takes ~15 minutes.

The health condition of the cats in Sanagijima is generally average; however, some are sick and thin. The hotel appears to be the only reliable facility caring for them, while other locations for food and water are somewhat neglected.

The night view is truly spectacular, but for your safety, it’s best to stay close to the hotel. The hotel has been refurbished from a former elementary school, and you may even find some friendly cats wandering around at any time during your stay.
