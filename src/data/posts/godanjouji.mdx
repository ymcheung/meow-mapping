## Access

### Takefu Station 武生駅

For foreign visitors, the best way to reach Takefu is to take Shinkansen to Fukui Station 福井駅 and then transfer to Takefu.

### Bicycle Ride

As you arrive at Takefu Station, I suggest either taking a taxi for approximately 20 minutes or enjoying a leisurely bicycle ride that takes about 1 hour.

Takefu is mostly a residential town, with only 2 rental bicycles available at the tourism information center near the train station.
