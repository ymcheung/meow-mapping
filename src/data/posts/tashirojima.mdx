## Access

### Ishinomaki 石巻

When we took the local train to Ishinomaki, it was crowded with students and office workers. I recommend traveling light so you can relax and not inconvenience the local residents.

### Ferry to Tashirojima 田代島

There are two local ports: Chuou (中央) and Kadonowaki (門脇). If you choose to take a taxi at Ishinomaki Station, be sure to tell the driver which port you want to go to.

Since the waters are choppy, remember to take your seasickness pills before leaving shore.

## Tashirojima 田代島

The island is perfect for a half-day hike, taking you from the coast to the mountain trails. If you start to feel tired, there’s a store where you can buy drinks, food, and souvenirs. The store owner seems to be the only person taking care of the cats, and most of them are well taken care of.

Did you stay at Tashirojima for a night or two before? Please share the experience with us.
