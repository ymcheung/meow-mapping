<Abstract transportation={frontmatter.transportation} />

As the symbol of a tourist destination in Kyoto, almost everyone visiting for the first time will go to Fushimi Inari Taisha see the long-anticipated Senbon Torii.

## Senbon Torii 千本鳥居

Most people stopped at Senbon Torii, but I planned to hike deep into the back mountain before sunset. After passing through the area, scattered bungalows and temples hinted at encountering cats in this world-famous spot.

## Mt. Inari 稻荷山

For safety, I could only hike the lower route since it would get dark after 17:00. The cats didn't appear until I made my way back along the path.

Most of the cats were staying in the gardens or cemeteries of the temples. This made the photos of them look mysterious, as if some of them were gods in disguise.
