## Access

### Tadoutsu 多度津

The ferry to Sanagijima is located at Tadotsu. It takes around 20 minutes from the train station by walking, or 5 minutes by taking a taxi.

There are 3 ferries a day between Tadotsu and Sanagijima.

If you are eligible for riding a motorbike in Japan, you could ride one, or a bicycle onto the ferry.

The ferry is steady and clean. There’s no need to take pills before being aboard. The trip is ~1 hour with a brief stop at Takamishima.

## Sanagijima

(形容貓整體的情況)

It is recommended that you spend one or two nights at the island and feel day and night views there. The only hostel in Sanagijima, Nekonojima, is reservation only. The walk from the port to Nekonoshima takes ~15 minutes.

The health condition of the cats is average. Some of them are sick and thin. Due to the hotel is possibly the only place to take care of them, other spots for food and water are a bit of unmanaged.

The night view is spectacular, you should not be away from the hotel though.
