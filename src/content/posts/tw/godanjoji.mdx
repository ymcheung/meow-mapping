Godanjoji is located in a countryside in Fukui (福井県).

The temple adopts up to 20 cats. They are healthy and clean overall.

## Access

### Takefu Station (武生駅)

Almost every express train stops at Takefu.

### Bicycle Ride

As you arrive at Takefu Station, I suggest either taking a taxi for approximately 20 minutes or enjoying a leisurely bicycle ride that takes about 1 hour.

Takefu is mostly a residential town, with only 2 rental bicycles available at the tourism information center near the train station.
