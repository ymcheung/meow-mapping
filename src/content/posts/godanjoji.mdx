import Abstract from '@pages/[...blogPost]/_Abstract.astro';

Godanjoji is located in the peaceful countryside of Fukui (福井県), making it a destination that requires a full day’s journey from nearby larger cities.

## Access

### Takefu Station 武生駅

For foreign visitors, the best way to reach Takefu is to take Shinkansen to Fukui Station (福井駅) and then transfer to Takefu.

### Bicycle Ride

As you arrive at Takefu Station, I suggest either taking a taxi for approximately 20 minutes or enjoying a leisurely bicycle ride that takes about 1 hour.

Takefu is mostly a residential town, with only 2 rental bicycles available at the tourism information center near the train station.

## Godanjoji 御誕生寺

The temple have adopted up to 20 cats for years. They are healthy and clean overall.
