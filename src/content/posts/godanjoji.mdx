Godanjoji is located in a countryside in Fukui (福井県). The trip will take up the whole day from other larger cities.

## Access

### Takefu Station (武生駅)

For foreign visitors, the best way to reach Takefu is to take the Shinkansen (新幹線) to Fukui (福井) and then transfer to Takefu.

### Bicycle Ride

As you arrive at Takefu Station, I suggest either taking a taxi for approximately 20 minutes or enjoying a leisurely bicycle ride that takes about 1 hour.

Takefu is mostly a residential town, with only 2 rental bicycles available at the tourism information center near the train station.

## Godanjoji (御誕生寺)

The temple have adopted up to 20 cats for years. They are healthy and clean overall.
